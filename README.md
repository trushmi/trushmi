## My Coding Journey

<details>
  
<summary> Open to read </summary>
	<br/>
I started my journey by writing ‚ÄúHello, World!‚Äù in JavaScript. Since then, I have expanded my expertise across multiple programming languages and technologies and collaborated with talented professionals on a variety of interesting projects.

After teaching myself JavaScript and React, I built my first project and portfolio website. Driven by a passion for software engineering, I enrolled in Hackbright Academy's coding bootcamp, where I completed 800+ hours of intensive training and successfully delivered 15+ solo, pair, and group projects. During the bootcamp, I learned Python as my second programming language, gained foundational knowledge in Java, and developed skills in working with relational databases like PostgreSQL.

Post-graduation, I developed a responsive TV show tracker app optimized for performance and data integration using React and JavaScript.

To deepen my full-stack skills, learn AWS and testing, I joined ProgramEquity‚Äôs Software Engineering Fellowship, working on an open-source project.

I then continued enhancing my skills as a software engineer by building a smart shopping list web application with The Collab Lab, an organization that helps early-career developers gain practical experience with support from mentors.

While contributing to this project, I expanded my knowledge of React, learned how to work with Firebase, and had the chance to conduct code reviews, work on user story points, and develop 15+ features such as item addition and deletion, validations, sorting, and filtering.

My journey continued with the ‚ÄòSupport SFUSD‚Äô project, where I contributed to building a website that engages San Francisco residents in supporting local schools. I gained hands-on experience with TypeScript and implemented search functionality across the stack to enhance the user experience.

I am always eager to learn and expand my knowledge. Currently, I am building a new project in C# and continuing to develop my expertise.
